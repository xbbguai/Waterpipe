# Waterpipe
An C++ event driven programming framework.

C++17 compiler is required.
The framework is about 200 lines of C++ codes only, in Base.h and Base.cpp.

Other files make up a test console game using Waterpipe.
This game is tested on macOS and Ubuntu Linux, but it will not run on Windows due to terminal compatibility problems.
